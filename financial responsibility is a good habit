It is very important to evaluate the cashflow so you can decide and control your spendings and be sure you make more then you spend.
Good and prooved strategy is to divide your income by the 50:30:20 ratio, where 50% goes to what you need to buy, as elecrticity, rent, grocery etc. 30% is what you want to buy, I do not need to tell you that and remaining 20% you should invest. 
Investing does not mean you have to give all 20% to the pension savings account in the bank. Remember to diversify your investments, invest some to your skill, knowledge, certifications. Try invest some to ETF or indexes and some little part to crypto, because it is new and one never know.
Investing can be considered also scaling your job or skill. Because if you improving you can do better job and make more money.
