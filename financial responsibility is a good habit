It is very important to evaluate the cashflow so you can decide and control your spendings and be sure you make more then you spend.
Good and prooved strategy is to divide your yncome by the 50:30:20 ratio, where 50% goes to what you need to buy, as elecrticity, rent, grocery etc. 30% is what you want to buy, I do not need to tell you that and remaining 20% you should invest.
