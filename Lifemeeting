Also if you live with your spouse, you should consider to make a date-life-meeting every month. 
Go for a dinner just you two and discuss all points you want to talk about or discuss.
Talk about you goals, shortterms and longterms, about things that made you proud and shame in last month and also discuss your financial situaton.
We often have meetings with our clients but we are forgetting to our most important partner.
Dinnes should be considered higly profesional, as the business meeting would be.
This will upgrade and scale your relationship to another level and also helps to review and set your common goals.
